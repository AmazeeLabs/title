About fuzzy matching
 (Some discussion between Brandon and myself on drupal-support)
====================


You will likely need to implement it yourself, since I am not aware of
an extant PHP implementation, but you should check into the Nilsimsa
digest algorithm:

http://ixazon.dynip.com/~cmeclax/nilsimsa.html

Store a nilsimsa hash of the title in the db along with each node and
then you can compute the nilsimsa hash for a given StudlyLink and do a
quick select to look for a node with a similar nilsimsa hash.

Yes, it's not blazingly fast, but if you want fuzzy matching it's
probably going to be no slower than any other algorithm and probably
faster than most of the others.  For instance, if you tried to use
LCS[0] for this you'd have to run an LCS comparison between the
StudlyLink and every node title in the database.  The time necessary to
run a nilsimsa test on every hash in the database is likely faster than
that necessary for LCS matching.  Plus, nilsimsa can be tweaked.  If
someone is running a site highly trafficked enough that they cannot
afford the CPU cycles necessary to run these nilsimsa tests they can
turn them off so that only exact hash matches will be returned via a
vanilla select.  Exact nilsimsa hash matching will *still* be fuzzy to
the extent that the nilsimsa algorithm itself accounts for small changes
in the data being hashed but will incur no computational overhead for
matching beyond what a select requires.

I don't have the time to do it right now, though it shouldn't be
difficult to do.  The Perl version BTW is not written in native Perl,
it's a Perl wrapper around the C version.  You could use SWIG[1] to
connect the C version to PHP or you could read the C source code and
reimplement in native PHP.  It's a toss up.  Who knows how stable PHP's
SWIG bindings are, but it's my instict that any attempt at a nilsimsa
implementation in native PHP is likely to suck.
